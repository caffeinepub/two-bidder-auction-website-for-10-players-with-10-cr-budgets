  "summary": "REQ-9 appears implemented on the frontend via backend error normalization and propagating readable English error messages through React Query mutations. REQ-8 cannot be confirmed from the provided backend diff snippet because the `bidPlayer` implementation/validation logic is not shown (file is truncated before that function).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-8",
      "requirement": "Fix backend `bidPlayer` validation to accept the two configured bidder names by checking membership in `auctionState.bidders` (and exactly 2 bidders), and trap with a clear English error if bidder is not part of the current auction.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows `startNewAuction` storing bidder names in `auctionState.bidders`, but does not show any changes to `bidPlayer` (the relevant validation logic). Since `backend/main.mo` is truncated before `bidPlayer`, there is no evidence that the hardcoded bidder-name check was replaced with a membership check or that the new trap message was added.",

        "backend/main.mo (truncated before bidPlayer)"
