REQ-2 is partially evidenced: rupee formatter and bid parsing changes are present, and Setup/Results/guards updates are shown; however, evidence is missing for AuctionScreen rupee label/text updates and for the AudienceScreen rupee formatting requirement.",

      "requirement": "AuctionScreen UI text reflects rupees (e.g., 'Bid Amount (₹)' instead of 'Bid Amount (CR)'), and bidder remaining/spent displays show ₹ values.",
      "reason": "AuctionScreen.tsx changes show bid parsing no longer scales by 1_000_000_000_000 and uses formatAmount, but the provided truncated diff does not include the relevant UI label/text strings or the budget/spent display rendering to confirm they were updated from 'CR' to '₹'.",

      "reason": "No diff content for AudienceScreen.tsx is provided among the modified files, so there is no direct evidence that the audience view was updated to use the rupee formatter.",
